      <h1>I live in my car.</h1>
      <p>Not by circumstance. By choice. And I built this app from the driver's seat.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 24px;">My name is Padrick Zulueta, and MyCarLife isn't a startup pitch — it's my daily reality.</p>

  <div class="page-content">

    <h2>The Real Story</h2>

    <p>Most app founders will tell you about their journey from idea to product. They'll talk about market research, user interviews, and pivot points.</p>

    <p>I'll tell you about the Walmart parking lot where I coded the first version. The Planet Fitness showers that kept me going. The public library WiFi that uploaded my first build to TestFlight.</p>

    <h2>How I Got Here</h2>

    <p><strong>1996:</strong> My brother Rico's mental illness became acute — schizoaffective disorder, around age 19-20. That same year, my oldest brother died by suicide.</p>

    <p><strong>1996-2016:</strong> ~20 years helping care for Rico and supporting mom. I did odd jobs and gymnastics coaching — enough to help, not enough to live independently.</p>

    <p><strong>2016:</strong> Eventually moved into a van. Dad passed away around this time. Couldn't afford rent on my own.</p>

    <p><strong>2016-2022:</strong> Lived in a van for six years.</p>

    <p><strong>2022-2024:</strong> My brother Ricardo and his wife took me in. They built an extension on top of their garage for me and Rico to live in together. The plan: get Rico out of the group home with me there to care for him.</p>

    <p><strong>2024:</strong> Ricardo adopted twins and moved the family to Florida. Lost the housing. Rico went back to a group home. I moved into my 4Runner.</p>

    <p><strong>Total: ~10 years of vehicle dwelling across two stretches. But ~20 years of family caregiving before that.</strong></p>

    <p>This started from taking care of family, not an Instagram van life dream. The van wasn't the beginning of sacrifice — it was the continuation of it.</p>

    <h2>The App That Almost Wasn't</h2>

    <p>In late 2025, I built a simple flashlight app called "Dim Light." Four colored lights, brightness starting at 1% — perfect for 3 AM when you need to see without waking yourself up or alerting anyone outside.</p>

    <p>Priced it at $2.99. Submitted to Apple.</p>

    <p><strong>Apple rejected it as spam.</strong></p>

    <p>"There are already enough of these apps on the App Store."</p>

    <p>I felt like Apple didn't understand. You don't understand how people live in vehicles. When it's pitch dark, the torch light is just too damn bright. It's not even about people finding out you're living in a vehicle — it's about waking yourself up from the bright light.</p>

    <p>But their rejection contained a hint: "Your app may include features or characteristics that distinguish it as more than just a flashlight app."</p>

    <p>So I built something bigger.</p>

    <h2>What I'm Building</h2>

    <p>MyCarLife is the first app that truly understands vehicle dwelling. Not as a novelty, but as a legitimate way of life.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dwell Score</strong> — A comprehensive assessment of your vehicle dwelling quality across 7 pillars. Know where you stand, track your progress.</li>
      <li><strong>Stealth Score</strong> — How well does your vehicle blend into different environments? Not about hiding — about belonging.</li>
      <li><strong>Resource Finder</strong> — Restrooms, showers, water, WiFi, safe parking. Curated specifically for us.</li>
      <li><strong>Community</strong> — Connect with people who get it. No explaining, no judgment.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Tools</strong> — Dim flashlight for stealth, task batching for errand runs, emergency resources always one tap away.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Mission</h2>

    <p>I believe your tools should match your ambition, not your circumstances.</p>

    <p>You might be living in a car, but that doesn't mean your software has to feel like an afterthought. MyCarLife is built with the same care and attention as apps for people with corner offices — because you deserve that too.</p>

    <h2>The Through-Line</h2>

    <p>I didn't wake up wanting to build an app. I woke up wanting life to feel more stable, dignified, navigable. Software became the tool. Rejection forced expansion from flashlight to platform. The platform revealed the need for a framework. The framework became the soul of the app.</p>

    <p>I didn't "come up with" MyCarLife. I discovered it by building the wrong app first — which is actually the right way most real products are born.</p>

    <h2>The Short Version</h2>

    <p>I built MyCarLife because I needed it. I live in a 4Runner. I've been vehicle dwelling, on and off, for about ten years. The app started as a night light — literally just a red screen so I could see without waking myself up or attracting attention outside my window covers.</p>

    <p>Apple rejected it as "flashlight spam."</p>

    <p>So I built something bigger.</p>

    <h2>The Background</h2>

    <p>Here's the context. I'm not going to make this dramatic.</p>

    <p>My brother Rico developed schizoaffective disorder around 1996. He was about 19. That same year, my oldest brother died by suicide.</p>

    <p>From then on — call it 20 years — I helped take care of Rico and support my mom. I did odd jobs, taught gymnastics classes. It was enough to help, never enough to build anything for myself.</p>

    <p>I'm not going to pretend I was some selfless caregiver. I wanted success. I wanted wealth. I wanted an adventurous life. I was frustrated that this kept getting in the way. I had complicated feelings about it. Still do.</p>

    <p>But I was around, and they needed help, so I helped. That's it. Low-energy, day-to-day stuff. Not dramatic. Just life.</p>

    <p>Eventually I couldn't afford rent. Around 2016, I moved into a van. My dad died around that time.</p>

    <p><strong>2016-2022:</strong> Van. Six years.</p>

    <p><strong>2022-2024:</strong> My brother Ricardo and his wife took me in. They built an extension on top of their garage — a place for me and Rico to live together. The plan was to get Rico out of his group home, which wasn't a good environment. I was there to help care for him.</p>

    <p><strong>2024:</strong> Ricardo adopted twins. Moved the family to Florida. I lost the housing. Rico went back to a group home. I moved into my 4Runner.</p>

    <p>That's where I am now.</p>

    <h2>The Rejection</h2>

    <p>September 2025. I built a night light app — four colors, 1% brightness default, two weeks of work. Submitted to Apple at $2.99.</p>

    <p>Rejected the next day.</p>

    <p><em>"Your app is primarily a flashlight app that duplicates the content and functionality of similar apps in a saturated category."</em></p>

    <p>It was discouraging. I felt like Apple didn't understand. You don't know how people live in vehicles. The torch light is too damn bright. It's not about hiding — it's about not waking yourself up.</p>

    <p>But the rejection letter had one line: "Your app may include features or characteristics that distinguish it as more than just a flashlight app."</p>

    <p>I took that seriously.</p>

    <h2>What I Built</h2>

    <p>If Apple wanted comprehensive, I'd build comprehensive.</p>

    <p>I started with the question: <strong>"How do you know if a parking spot is good?"</strong></p>

    <p>That became the Stealth Score — two separate scores for your vehicle setup and your parking location.</p>

    <p>Then I pushed further: What about everything else? What about actually thriving at this?</p>

    <p>That became the <strong>Dwell Score</strong> — 7 pillars measuring vehicle health, documents, finances, wellbeing, parking stability, connection, and purpose.</p>

    <p>The question evolved from "Is this spot good?" to <strong>"How well do you dwell?"</strong></p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

    <p>I'm not adjacent to this problem. I'm inside it.</p>

    <p>I didn't research vehicle dwelling to find a market opportunity. I live it. Every feature in this app exists because I needed it — or because I watched someone else need it.</p>

    <p>The night light exists because I was tired of waking myself up.</p>

    <p>The Stealth Score exists because I got nervous in the wrong parking lots.</p>

    <p>The Dwell Score exists because surviving isn't enough. I wanted to know: am I actually okay? Not just tonight — overall?</p>

    <h2>One More Thing</h2>

    <p>I'm not a naturally gifted person. I had to work hard for my grades. I had to work hard for my social life. I had to work hard for everything.</p>

    <p>I look back and wonder if I made mistakes — if I should have isolated and grinded instead of trying to have it all. I wanted success and adventure and connection and wealth. Maybe that was naive.</p>

    <p>But here's where I landed: I'm 51, living in a 4Runner, building an app that I actually need. The circumstances aren't what I planned. But the work is real.</p>

    <p>I'm not asking for sympathy. I'm just telling you where this came from.</p>

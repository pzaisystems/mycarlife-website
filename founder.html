      <h1>I live in my car.</h1>
      <p>Not by circumstance. By choice. And I built this app from the driver's seat.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 24px;">My name is Padrick Zulueta, and MyCarLife isn't a startup pitch — it's my daily reality.</p>

  <!-- Story Content -->
  <div class="page-content">
    <h2>The Real Story</h2>
    <p>Most app founders will tell you about their journey from idea to product. They'll talk about market research, user interviews, and pivot points.</p>
    <p>I'll tell you about the Walmart parking lot where I coded the first version. The Planet Fitness showers that kept me going. The public library WiFi that uploaded my first build to TestFlight.</p>
    <p>MyCarLife was born out of necessity. I needed a tool that understood my reality — not a camping app for weekend warriors, not a vanlife aesthetic platform, but something for people actually living this life full-time.</p>

    <h2>Why Vehicle Dwelling?</h2>
    <p>There are over 3 million vehicle dwellers in America. Some are here by choice — digital nomads, minimalists, people who reject the rent trap. Others are here by circumstance — housing costs that outpaced wages, life transitions, starting over.</p>
    <p>What we all share is a need for tools that work for OUR lifestyle. Mainstream apps assume you have a permanent address, consistent power, reliable WiFi. We don't have those luxuries.</p>

    <h2>What I'm Building</h2>
    <p>MyCarLife is the first app that truly understands vehicle dwelling. Not as a novelty, but as a legitimate way of life.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dwell Score</strong> — A comprehensive assessment of your vehicle dwelling quality across 7 pillars. Know where you stand, track your progress.</li>
      <li><strong>Resource Finder</strong> — Restrooms, showers, water, WiFi, safe parking. Curated specifically for us.</li>
      <li><strong>Community</strong> — Connect with people who get it. No explaining, no judgment.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Tools</strong> — Dim flashlight for stealth, task batching for errand runs, emergency resources always one tap away.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>I believe your tools should match your ambition, not your circumstances.</p>
    <p>You might be living in a car, but that doesn't mean your software has to feel like an afterthought. MyCarLife is built with the same care and attention as apps for people with corner offices — because you deserve that too.</p>

    <h2>Where This Goes</h2>
    <p>This isn't a side project. This is my life's work.</p>
    <p>I'm building MyCarLife to be the operating system for vehicle dwelling — the one app that makes this lifestyle not just survivable, but thriving.</p>
    <p>If you're living this life, or thinking about it, or know someone who is — I built this for you.</p>

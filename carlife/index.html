    <p>Most aren't Instagram influencers in converted Sprinter vans. They're working families priced out of housing. Retirees whose savings couldn't keep pace with rent. People for whom a car payment became more affordable than a studio apartment.</p>

    <p>Vehicle dwelling has increased <strong>213%</strong> in American cities since 2006. It's the fastest-growing form of housing instability in the country — and almost nobody's talking about it.</p>

    <h2>The Spectrum: Crisis to Choice</h2>

    <p>Vehicle dwellers aren't one thing.</p>

    <p><strong>Some chose this life.</strong> Remote workers who traded rent for freedom. Retirees chasing sunsets across the West. Minimalists who discovered that less stuff meant more living. They have savings, fallback options, and purpose-built rigs with solar panels and running water.</p>

    <p><strong>Others arrived by crisis.</strong> An eviction that happened too fast. A medical bill that broke everything. A rent increase that made the math impossible. They're employed but can't afford first/last/deposit. They moved from apartment to car because it was the only door still open.</p>

    <p>Research shows <strong>70%</strong> of vehicle dwellers in safe parking programs are experiencing homelessness for the first time. They're more likely to be women, have children, have jobs, and successfully transition to housing than other homeless populations.</p>

    <p>They're not failures. They're people whose options failed them.</p>

    <h2>Houseless, Not Homeless</h2>

    <p>There's a word distinction the community uses carefully.</p>

    <p><strong>Homeless</strong> suggests absence. No shelter. Nothing.</p>

    <p><strong>Houseless</strong> acknowledges reality: <em>I have a home. It has wheels.</em> It's partly rejection of how "the system" defines a home. Partly dignity.</p>

    <p>Car Life exists in that space — between what society calls housing and what actually provides shelter, safety, and stability. The vehicle isn't a stopgap. For millions, it <em>is</em> home.</p>

    <h2>What We're Building</h2>

    <p>MyCarLife isn't a camping app. It's not another list of free parking spots.</p>

    <p>It's a platform built <strong>by</strong> someone who lives this life <strong>for</strong> people who live this life.</p>

    <h3>We measure what matters:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Dwell Score</strong> tracks overall thriving — not just parking, but vehicle health, documents, finances, wellbeing, connection, and purpose</li>
      <li>The <strong>Stealth Score</strong> helps you assess how well your vehicle blends into different environments</li>
      <li><strong>Spot Checks</strong> capture real-time intel on parking locations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>We connect instead of isolate:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Community features that work for people who move</li>
      <li>Resources organized by what vehicle dwellers actually need</li>
      <li>A place where the question "where do you live?" doesn't require an apology</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>We dignify instead of shame:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No pity. No judgment. No lectures about "getting back on your feet"</li>
      <li>Practical tools for practical problems</li>
      <li>Recognition that this life — chosen or not — deserves support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Reality We're Addressing</h2>

    <p>Every basic human need that housed people take for granted becomes a daily logistics problem:</p>

    <p><strong>Parking dominates consciousness.</strong> Never the same spot twice. Rotations of 4-6 locations. Reading signals — which lots generate complaints, which security guards look the other way, which Walmarts still say yes.</p>

    <p><strong>Bathroom access creates constant anxiety.</strong> $10/month gym memberships aren't luxury — they're survival infrastructure. Emergency buckets exist because nighttime options don't.</p>

    <p><strong>Invisibility is safety.</strong> Looking "normal" affects employment, police interactions, and community tolerance. Stealth isn't paranoia. It's learned wisdom from a society that criminalizes people for sleeping in the only shelter they can afford.</p>

    <p><strong>Mental health compounds everything.</strong> Isolation has health impacts equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes daily. Constant hypervigilance about police, security, and neighbors creates chronic stress. The question "is this a mistake?" never fully leaves.</p>

    <h2>What Separates Thriving from Surviving</h2>

    <p>Research reveals clear patterns:</p>

    <p><strong>Preparation matters.</strong> Those who thrive researched before starting, tested the lifestyle, ensured vehicle reliability, established income streams, and learned basic mechanical skills.</p>

    <p><strong>Financial stability predicts outcomes.</strong> Emergency funds for repairs, consistent income even if modest, careful budgeting. Minimum viable costs run $600/month with slow pace and boondocking; comfortable dwelling costs $800-2,000+.</p>

    <p><strong>Vehicle health is existential.</strong> Vehicle failure means losing shelter, transportation, belongings, and often employment simultaneously.</p>

    <p><strong>Community provides resilience.</strong> Shared knowledge, troubleshooting help, emotional support, belonging. The difference between surviving alone and thriving together.</p>

    <p><strong>Mindset shapes trajectory.</strong> Adaptability over rigidity. Problem-solving over complaining. Reframing from "I can't afford housing" to "I'm living differently."</p>

    <h2>The Movement</h2>

    <p>Car Life isn't a phase. For millions, it's a parallel housing system that emerged because traditional housing stopped working.</p>

    <p>Some will transition back to apartments and houses. Some will stay on the road for decades. Some will find their way between — RVs in winter, apartments when health requires it, vans for part-time adventure.</p>

    <p>All deserve tools that work. Community that sees them. Dignity that doesn't require a permanent address.</p>

    <p><strong>That's what we're building.</strong></p>

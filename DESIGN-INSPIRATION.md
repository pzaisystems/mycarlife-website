## Color Palette Ideas

- Text: #FFFFFF (white)
- Accent: Purple/violet gradients
- Subtle: Gray tones for secondary text

**For MyCarLife:**
- Background: #0A0A0B or #000000
- Primary Accent: #FFB347 (amber/orange - matches app)
- Text: #FFFFFF
- Secondary: #8E8E93 (gray)
- Gradient: Amber to orange glow behind screenshots

---

## Screenshots Needed

- [ ] Hero shot: Main app screen (My tab or Car Life tab)
- [ ] Community feed
- [ ] Dwell Score results
- [ ] Calendar view
- [ ] Flashlight/Dim Light feature

**Note:** Screenshots should be on device mockups (iPhone frames) with subtle shadows/glows

## Notes

- Start simple, iterate
- Static HTML/CSS first (fast, no build step)
- Can add animations/interactions later
- Mobile-first responsive design

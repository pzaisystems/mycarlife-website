    <p>How a rejected flashlight app evolved into a comprehensive framework for vehicle dwelling success.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 1: The Rejected Flashlight</h2>

    <p>It started with a simple idea: a flashlight app for people living in vehicles.</p>

    <p>In late 2025, Padrick Zulueta — a full-time vehicle dweller living in a 2005 Toyota 4Runner while working as a delivery driver — built "Dim Light." The concept was straightforward: four colored lights in a diamond formation, with brightness controls optimized for stealth. Unlike a regular flashlight that blasts white light and draws attention, Dim Light started at 1% brightness. Perfect for 3 AM when you need to grab a water bottle without waking yourself up or alerting anyone outside.</p>

    <p>He priced it at $2.99 and submitted it to Apple.</p>

    <p><strong>Apple rejected it as spam.</strong></p>

    <p>The rejection notice was blunt: "Your app prominently features flashlight functionality. There are already enough of these apps on the App Store."</p>

    <p>But Apple's own rejection contained a hint: "Your app may include features or characteristics that distinguish it as more than just a flashlight app."</p>

    <p>Padrick took that hint seriously.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: The Question That Changed Everything</h2>

    <p>The app needed a soul — a core concept that tied everything together. That's when the scoring system emerged.</p>

    <p>The question was simple: <strong>How do you know if a parking spot is good?</strong></p>

    <p>Not "is it legal" or "is it safe" — but comprehensively good. The kind of spot where you can actually sleep well, feel secure, and not worry about a knock on the window at 3 AM.</p>

    <p>Through research into vehicle dwelling communities, a framework emerged. Successful vehicle dwelling came down to four factors:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visibility</strong> — Will I be noticed?</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimacy</strong> — Am I allowed here?</li>
      <li><strong>Safety</strong> — Is this spot secure?</li>
      <li><strong>Livability</strong> — Can I actually live here?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This became the foundation for the <strong>Spot Check</strong> — a quick assessment any vehicle dweller could run on any parking location.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3: Surviving vs. Thriving</h2>

    <p>But something nagged at Padrick.</p>

    <p>The Four Pillars measured whether you could <strong>park somewhere successfully</strong>. They said nothing about whether you were actually <strong>thriving at vehicle dwelling</strong>.</p>

    <p>Someone could score 95% on all four pillars — invisible, allowed, safe spot — and still be eating garbage, never exercising, isolated from everyone, depressed and scrolling TikTok 14 hours a day, broke with no plan.</p>

    <p>That's not thriving. That's surviving in a good parking spot.</p>

    <p>The question evolved from "Is this spot good?" to <strong>"How well do you dwell?"</strong></p>

    <h2>Chapter 4: The Seven Pillars</h2>

    <p>The Dwell Score expanded to measure the whole person, not just parking:</p>

    <div class="pillar-grid">
      <div class="pillar-card">
        <h4>Vehicle Health <span>20%</span></h4>
        <p>Vehicle failure = lose shelter + transportation + employment simultaneously</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-card">
        <h4>Foundation <span>20%</span></h4>
        <p>Legal standing, documents, domicile — can't access jobs, benefits, or housing without valid ID</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-card">
        <h4>Resources <span>20%</span></h4>
        <p>Income, savings, financial sustainability — no money = can't fix problems in any other pillar</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-card">
        <h4>Wellbeing <span>15%</span></h4>
        <p>Physical health, mental state, sleep, nutrition, hygiene</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-card">
        <h4>Connection <span>10%</span></h4>
        <p>Relationships, community — isolation increases mortality risk</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-card">
        <h4>Purpose <span>10%</span></h4>
        <p>Direction, mindset — carries you through setbacks</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillar-card">
        <h4>Parking Stability <span>5%</span></h4>
        <p>Important but most recoverable — 30 minutes to find a new spot</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>From Spam to System</h2>

    <p>What started as a "$2.99 flashlight spam" rejection became something much more significant: <strong>a comprehensive framework for understanding what makes vehicle dwelling sustainable</strong>.</p>

    <p>The Dwell Score isn't just a feature — it's the soul of the app. It represents a genuine attempt to understand what vehicle dwellers actually need, built collaboratively through questioning, research, and real-world insight.</p>

    <p>Apple wanted to see something that wasn't just another flashlight. They got a framework that might actually help 3.1 million Americans understand whether they're surviving or thriving — and what they can do about it.</p>
